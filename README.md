## Overview

This repository contains a project for detecting breast cancer, developed as part of the IPMV (Image Processing and Machine Vision) course. The project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Methodology 
### Otsu's Method for Cancer Detection

This project leverages Otsu's thresholding method for image segmentation. Otsu's method is an automatic threshold selection technique that separates the pixels of an image into two classes (background and foreground) based on their histogram. In the context of breast cancer detection, Otsu's method helps to segment suspicious regions from mammography or microscopy images, facilitating the identification and analysis of potential cancerous areas.

## Repository Structure
